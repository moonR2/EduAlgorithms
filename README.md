# EduAlgorithms
Hi, I am Andr√©s Orozco in this repo you will find a lot of Algorithms for educational purposes. I do this to share many of the algorithms that I am developing while I study TICS at Yachay Tech University. Please do not use these Algorithms for professional purposes since there may be bugs, and may not be programmed in the most optimal way.
